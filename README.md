With Apiker, you can create an API in only 3 lines of code

const routes = { "/users/:id/hello": () => res("Hello World!") };

apiker.init({ routes, exports, objects: ["Common"] });

```
> ‚û°Ô∏è GET /users/my-user/hello
```
{ "message": "Hello World!" }
```

- Get and set object state easily. e.g: `await state().get(paramInCommonObj);` or `await state("MyObjectName").put({ myParam });`

**New**:
- Rate Limiting

- Ability to send emails (with Sendinblue)
- Simple Admin panel
- User IP geolocation
- Logging handlers

## üìï Why Apiker?

Apiker was developed to cut down on API building time and complexity. API creation can take a considerable time, and it often represents the main painpoint in getting your MVP to production.

The goal of Apiker is to let you jump straight to route creation, where you can leverage persistent key-value state quickly. Apiker also provides useful handlers should you need them, such as JWT Auth, Hashing, Rate Limiting, Email, among others.
